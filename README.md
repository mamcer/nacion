A .NET WeForms application from 2008


In `original` branch you will find the original source code for this application. In `master` an upgraded, refactored version.

## Description 

In 2008 we bought our first appartment with my wife. We pay it using our savings and a mortgage. This web application allow us to see general information about the mortgage and the current fee to pay, number of fees already paid, etc. And a simulator to estimate the interest earned if we pay in advance a certain amount of fees or how much money we needed to pay in advance a certain amount of fees.

Originalmente realizado en vs2008 utilizando tfs2008 como source control y management del proyecto.

Information that wasn´t available at that moment in the web application of our bank.

> Funny fact: At the same time I wanted to learn more about Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS). I my Windows Vista laptopI have installed and configured a Virtual Box virtual machine with a Windows Server and an installation of TFS 2008. All with only 2GB of ram!
